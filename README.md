# sample-satellite-imagery
Collection of sample satellite images and metadata

## Who is this for?

Really anyone who needs sample satellite imagery to test their app or processing chain. Imagery formats are messy, and this catalogue is intended to contain many pathological examples you will encounter in the wild.

## How to contribute

We encourage community donations of imagery to the catalogue. To keep things consistent, here are some guidelines:

1. Maximum file size is 10MB per image
2. Pretty images are preferred :sparkle:
3. Images should highlight one particular difficult aspect of real-world data (see issues)
4. Accompanying [STAC](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec)-formatted metadata is mandatory (details to follow)
5. Metadata must include attribution

If you want to add new data, please open a [pull request](/pulls), and take questions or suggestions to [our issues](/issues).
